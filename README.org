#+title: Readme

This repo contains the files used to generate my dotfiles. It uses Org Mode to
have the configuration and documentation side by side for clarity. The code
blocks containing the configuration are then ~tangled~ into the actual
configuration files in the ~out~ directory. From here, they can be symlinked
into the actual sytem using ~stow out~.

* Notes:

   - Terminal prompt is [[https://starship.rs][Starship]]
   - Font is [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code]]
   - Forge requires some configuration (as noted in [[./Emacs.org][Emacs.org]])
